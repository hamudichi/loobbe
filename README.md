## Neural Network

loobbe attempts to mimic brain tissue.
Neurons poses few modes of communication. The main mode of neuron-neuron
communication is through impulses. A neuron fires and the depolarization
of the neuron triggers a cascade through its axon which goes on to connect
to a number of other neurons or external "actuators". Chemical signaling
is another pathway for neuron-neuron communication. It maybe be added in
the future.  The key difference between loobbe and other neural networks
is that loobbe does not consist of many small connected software objects
Each having methods to allow access and such. loobbe modules attempt to
mimic real cells which have no access methods. Communication will consist
entirely of impulses. The objective of loobbe as a project is to create
a neural network that can be trained to perform certain tasks and that
can be visualized to create beautiful visuals.

## About

loobbe was inspired by my teacher Dr. Hubert deBruin. [Dr. H. deBruin][1]
explained that the label "neural network" is applied liberally in Software.
In reality neurons do not poses complex inputs and outputs. Neurons
function mainly as integrators of the stimulus received at dendrites.
Each neuron can be connected up to 100,000 other neurons. The intelligence
does not live in the neurons but in the communication between the neurons.
Somehow out of the disorder of a billion neurons firing we have coherent
thoughts. I set out to create a software network that recreates this
"order out of disorder" phenomenon in software.
