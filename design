class Cell
        can be poked,
        must receive more than x amount of pokes to activate
        the more pokes received from a certain direction the more responsive this cell becomes to the pokes
        can be killed if it pokes too much
        can poke multiple cells simultaneously
        poking depletes the surrounding resources slightly.
        has a location
        is more affected by pokes of close by axons
        can have up to 100,000 dendrites
        dendrites becomes more receptive the more pokes received.
        cells have a baseline firing rate. more stimulation from surrounding cells causes faster firing

axon
        has beginning
        has end 
	uses resources in surrounding regions along the axon to propagate impulse along its length

Concept Reward:
        Reward is global. All cells receive reward or all cells do not receive reward

Concept Starting energy
        we start with a set amount of energy that is external but is delivered to the cells that require it

task
        Some metrics upon which more energy is afforded to the cells
        the task is given through interface neurons? not sure
        the task will not be programmed in the loobbe design.
        what triggers specialization?


Success
        level
        adaptation
        specialization
        self preservation

Resources
        Resources at a none supply location diffuse like a salt diffuses in water

Physical limit
        Each cell occupies a finite amount of space. Each cell cannot grow beyond a certain size limit
        the total size of the cells cannot exceed a certain limit

System input
        resources
        task (impulses)

System output
        impulses

Interpreter
        interprets impulses in a specified way that is not formally known to the cells

All modules have state methods so that the internal workings of the lobe can be  viewed
