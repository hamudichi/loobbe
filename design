class Cell
	can be poked, 
	must recieve more than x amount of pokes to activate
	the more pokes recieved from a certain direction the more responsive this cell becomes to the pokes
	can be killed if it pokes too much
	can poke multiple cells simultaniously
	poking depletes the surrounding resources slightly.
	has a location
	is more affected by pokes of close by axons
	can have up to 100,000 dendrites
	dendrites becomes more receptive the more pokes recieved.

axon
	has beginning
	has end

Concept Reward:
	Reward is global. All cells recieve reward or all cells do not recieve reward

Concept Starting energy
	we start with a set amount of energy that is external but is delivered to the cells that require it

task
	Some metrics upon which more energy is afforded to the cells
	the task is given through interface neurons? not sure
	the task will not be preprogrammed in the loobbe design.
	what triggers specilization?


Success level
	adaptation
	specilization
	self preservation
